<p>Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent
  use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood
  levels of amoxicillin.</p>
<p>Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere
  with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro;
  however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.</p>
<p>In common with other antibiotics, AMOXIL (amoxicillin) may affect the gut flora, leading
  to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone
  contraceptives.</p>

<p><b>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: </b>High urine concentrations of ampicillin
  may result in falsepositive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose 
  in urine using CLINITEST&reg;, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution. Since
  this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose
  tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX&reg;)
  be used.</p>
<p>Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease
  in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated
  estrone, and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with amoxicillin.</p>
