<p>
If you have an allergic reaction after taking an antibiotic in the penicillin family, you should: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop taking the medication and ask your doctor about another antibiotic </li>

<li>Avoid using penicillin in the future </li>
</ul>
<p>
Treatment for signs and symptoms you develop during an allergic reaction to penicillin depends on what kind of reaction you have. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong> is the most rare and serious allergic drug reaction. It can be life-threatening and requires an injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) and emergency care to maintain blood pressure and support breathing.</li>
<li><strong>Rashes or hives</strong> may improve when treated with an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl, others). More severe reactions may require treatment with oral or injected corticosteroids. </li>
</ul>
