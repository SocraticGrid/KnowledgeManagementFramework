<p>
With any food allergy, treatment includes taking steps to avoid the food that causes your reaction, learning what steps you can take to relieve minor symptoms, and knowing how to spot and respond to a severe reaction. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Being prepared for a reaction</strong> <br />
The only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid peanuts and peanut products altogether. But peanuts are common, and despite your best efforts, you're likely to come into contact with peanuts at some point. 

</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For a minor allergic reaction,</strong> over-the-counter or prescribed antihistamines may help reduce symptoms. These drugs can be taken after exposure to peanuts to help relieve itching or hives. However, antihistamines aren't enough to treat a severe allergic reaction.</li>
<li><strong>For a severe allergic reaction,</strong> you may need an emergency injection of epinephrine and a trip to the emergency room. Many people with allergies carry an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, EpiPen Jr or Twinject). This device is a combined syringe and concealed needle that injects a single dose of medication when pressed against your thigh.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Know how to use your autoinjector</strong> <br />
If your doctor has prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Carry it with you at all times.</strong> It may be a good idea to keep an extra autoinjector in your car or in your desk at work as well.</li>
<li><strong>Always replace it before its expiration date.</strong> Out-of-date epinephrine may not work properly.</li>
<li><strong>Ask your doctor to prescribe a backup autoinjector.</strong> If you misplace one, you'll have a spare.</li>
<li><strong>Know how to operate it.</strong> Ask your doctor to show you. Also, make sure the people closest to you know how to use it &mdash; if someone with you can give you a shot in an anaphylactic emergency, he or she could save your life.</li>

<li><strong>Know when to use it.</strong> Talk to your doctor about how to recognize when a shot is needed. For a mild allergic reaction to peanuts, it may be OK to go to straight to the emergency room without using an autoinjector. However, if you're not sure whether the reaction is severe enough to warrant a shot, it's usually better to err on the side of caution and use the emergency epinephrine.</li>
</ul>
