<p>ZITHROMAX (azithromycin) is indicated for the treatment of patients with mild
  to moderate infections (pneumonia: see <b>WARNINGS</b>) caused by susceptible
  strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below.</p>
<h4>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</h4>
<p>Non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to <i>Chlamydia trachomatis.</i></p>
<p>ZITHROMAX (azithromycin) , at the recommended dose, should not be relied upon to treat gonorrhea or syphilis. Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat non-gonococcal urethritis may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating gonorrhea or syphilis. All patients with sexually-transmitted urethritis or cervicitis should have a serologic test for syphilis and appropriate cultures for gonorrhea performed at the time of diagnosis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy and follow-up tests for these diseases should be initiated if infection is confirmed.</p>

<p>Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to azithromycin. Therapy with ZITHROMAX (azithromycin)  may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once the results become available, antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Zithromax (azithromycin) and other antibacterial drugs, Zithromax (azithromycin) should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p>
<h4>Mycobacterial Infections</h4>
<h5>Prophylaxis of Disseminated <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex (MAC) Disease</h5>
<p>ZITHROMAX (azithromycin) , taken alone or in combination with rifabutin at its approved dose,
  is indicated for the prevention of disseminated <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex
  (MAC) disease in persons with advanced HIV infection.
