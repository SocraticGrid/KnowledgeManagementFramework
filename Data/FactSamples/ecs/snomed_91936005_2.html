<p>
Penicillin allergy is an overreaction by your immune system to penicillin and related antibiotics. If you have a penicillin allergy, your reaction to taking the antibiotic may range from a rash to anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition. 
</p>
<p>
Penicillin allergy is the most common drug allergy. Penicillin antibiotics are widely prescribed for bacterial infections such as strep throat. However, not all unfavorable reactions to penicillin are a true penicillin allergy.

<p>
It isn't clear why some people develop penicillin allergy. Once you've had an allergic reaction to penicillin, the simplest way to prevent penicillin allergy is to avoid penicillin and related antibiotics.
