<h2>How should I take azithromycin?</h2>
<p>Take azithromycin exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. The dose and length of treatment with azithromycin may not be the same for every type of infection</p>
<p>To use the oral suspension single dose packet: Open the packet and pour the medicine into 2 ounces of water. Stir this mixture and drink all of it right away. Do not save for later use. Throw away any mixed oral suspension that has not been used within 12 hours.</p>
<p>To make sure you get the entire dose, add a little more water to the same glass, swirl gently and drink right away.</p>
<p>Azithromycin may be taken with or without food. Take the medicine with food if it upsets your stomach.</p>

<p>Shake the oral suspension (liquid) well just before you measure a dose. To be sure you get the correct dose, measure the liquid with a marked measuring spoon or medicine cup, not with a regular table spoon. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.</p>
<p>Take azithromycin for the full prescribed length of time. Your symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cleared. Azithromycin will not treat a viral infection such as the common cold or flu.</p>
<p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Throw away any unused liquid medicine after 10 days</p>
<h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2>
<p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p>
