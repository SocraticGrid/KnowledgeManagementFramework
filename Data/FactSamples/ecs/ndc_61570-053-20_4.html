<h3>Azithromycin</h3>
<p>
 (capsule or suspension), intravenous therapy, eye drop
</p><p>Azithromycin is an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibiotics.Azithromycin is one of the world's best-selling antibiotics, sold in the United States under the name Zithromax, and under a variety of brand names and generic labels worldwide.<br/> It is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring, thus making the lactone ring 15-membered.<br/> </p><p>Azithromycin is used to treat or prevent certain bacterial infections, most often those causing Otitis media, tonsillitis, throat infections, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, Typhoid, and sinusitis.<br/> In recent years it has primarily been used to prevent bacterial infections in infants and those with weaker immune systems.<br/> It is also effective against certain venereal diseases, such as non-gonococcal urethritis, chlamydia infection, gonorrhea and cervicitis.<br/> Recent studies have also indicated it to be effective against late-onset asthma, but these findings are controversial and not widely accepted.<br/>





































 Note that whereas the traditional zpack (500mg + 4 days of 250 mg) may be used in some instances, particularly for strep in pediatric cases, for adults over 88 pounds, the PDR calls for five (5) days of 500mg for strep throat, and yet the pediatric lesser dose is commonly mis-prescribed.<br/>Physicians Desk Reference, Azithromycin, 2009.</p>
