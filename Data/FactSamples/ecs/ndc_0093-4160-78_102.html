<p>AMOXIL (amoxicillin)  may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the strength
  of the product prescribed.</p>
<p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including AMOXIL (amoxicillin) , should
  only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections
  (e.g., the common cold). When AMOXIL (amoxicillin)  is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection,
  patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the
  course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping
  doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness
  of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will
  develop resistance and will not be treatable by AMOXIL (amoxicillin)  or other antibacterial
  drugs in the future.</p>
