<h3>Amoxicillin</h3>
Amoxicillin (International Nonproprietary Name), formerly amoxycillin (British Approved Name), amoxycillin (cilamox) in Australia, Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Leaflet., abbreviated Amox,Tormoxin (in India), is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, beta-lactam antibiotic antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.<br/> It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other beta-lactam antibiotics.<br/> It is also a treatment for cystic acne.<br/>





</p><p>Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, and so may be given with clavulanic acid to decrease its susceptibility.<br/></p>
